			<p>Deane Nettles is a graphic designer, photographer, and illustrator. He has a BA in News Journalism  and an MFA in Integrated Design from the University of Baltimore. He currently freelances for various clients and teaches at numerous colleges and universities in the DC/Baltimore area.</p>

			<p>Deane began on a community college newspaper as a photographer, but also leaned what was then known as "pasteup". He got his degree in news journalism from Kent State and went back for a degree in advertising design while editing the same community college student paper. A former editor got him a position working as a production artist at boutique agency Morgan Burchette; from there he became art director at KSK Communications. Since then he has freelanced for ad agencies, design studios and direct marketing firms. He has also art directed several publications and was senior art director at August, Lang &amp; Husak in Bethesda.</p>

			<p>Deane is a past president and life member of the Art Directors Club of Metropolitan Washington, where he ran the Annual Show, chaired programs and produced a workshop in logo design conducted by Paula Scher. He is an occasional contributor to DC and Baltimore AIGAs.</p>

			<p>Since 2006 he has taught at area colleges and universities, including intro courses in design and web design and advanced courses in typography, advertising and branding.</p>

			<p>Deane enjoys working with energetic, committed teams of fellow designers — teams so dedicated they're told to quiet down because they're having too much fun and then enthusiastically continue those discussions after work over pizza and beer.</p>

			<p>Deane is married with a wife, a dog and a cat; is currently learning type design and javascript; draws, paints and sculpts; bikes over a thousand miles a year; and dances and teaches swing, waltz, blues and zydeco.</p>
